/** \file rs_rum.h
* \brief
* Exposes RUM (Real User Monitoring) functionality for C compilers.
*
* RUM collects anonymous, aggregated SDK usage statistics locally. Data only leaves
* the machine when the user explicitly opts in to cloud upload. These entry points are
* always compiled and functional: rs2_rum_get_report_path returns the path of the on-disk
* report file (SDK/system metadata plus whatever has been collected) and the consent get/set
* always read and write the per-user config file. The ENABLE_STATS build option (default ON)
* gates only the instrumentation hooks that feed the collector; when it is off the report's
* collected lists (devices, streams, filters, options, notifications) stay empty, but
* the API itself behaves identically.
